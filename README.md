# UX

- ### User stories

- #### New User's Goals

  - As a new user, my goal is to actively engage with the news site by reading, and commenting on news stories.
  - As a first-time user, I prioritize the security of my account-related information and would like the option to sign out at the end of each session.
  - As a newcomer to the site, I expect a user-friendly experience that allows me to easily navigate and find the content I'm interested in.

- #### Returning and Frequent User's Goals

  - As a returning user, my priority is to quickly and securely sign into my user account for seamless access.
  - As a frequent user of the platform, I value the ability to engage with the content by liking and commenting on posts.
  - As a returning and security-conscious user, I make it a point to sign out of my account at the end of each session to ensure the safety of my personal information.

- #### Site Administrator Goals

  - As a Site Administrator, I require comprehensive control over the website, including the ability to publish blogs/news, manage user data, review and moderate comments, oversee site functionality, edit content, and have the authority to remove or delete user accounts when necessary.
